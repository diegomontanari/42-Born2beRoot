## Virtual Machines
A virtual machine (VM) is a simulated computer running inside a physical computer. It operates as an isolated system with its own operating system, memory, storage, and processing resources, all managed independently from the host system.

### How a Virtual Machine Works
A virtual machine operates through software called a **Hypervisor - Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)**, which manages and coordinates the following key components:

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** ‚Üí The "brain" of the computer. It processes calculations and program instructions, coordinating the operation of all other parts, such as memory, storage, and peripherals.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** ‚Üí Temporary memory that serves critical functions:
  - Acts as a workspace where the computer runs programs and processes active data.
  - Provides fast access to temporary data, which is erased when the computer is turned off.
  - Unlike the hard drive (which is slower but permanent), RAM allows quick retrieval of necessary information for active tasks.
- **Hard Drive (Storage Disk)** ‚Üí The computer's permanent "storage unit," where data is preserved, including:
  - Files (documents, photos, videos, etc.)
  - Installed programs
  - The operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Two common types of storage: HDD (Hard Disk Drive) ‚Äì mechanical, cheaper but slower; SSD (Solid State Drive) ‚Äì electronic, faster but more expensive.
- **Network Card** ‚Üí Allows the computer to connect to the Internet or a local network via Ethernet cable or wireless.
- **Input/Output Devices** ‚Üí Keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, etc.

### Role of the Hypervisor
‚≠ê The hypervisor abstracts and **distributes hardware resources among different virtual machines** (VMs), enabling them to function independently. There are two main types:

- **Bare-Metal Hypervisors** ‚Üí Run directly on hardware without a host OS, making them *more efficient and secure since they access physical resources directly*. Examples: Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM.
- **Hosted Hypervisors** ‚Üí Installed as software on an existing OS, *easier to configure but slightly less efficient due to additional abstraction*. Examples: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox.

A hypervisor is responsible for:
- Allocating physical resources across multiple virtual machines
- Scheduling CPU instruction execution
- Managing shared memory
- Controlling access to peripherals

### Purpose of Virtual Machines
Virtual machines allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine while keeping each environment completely separate and secure. This technology is essential for optimizing hardware usage, testing software in a secure environment, and managing system backups efficiently. Virtualization also enables seamless migration of virtual environments across different physical computers, ensuring **flexibility and operational continuity**.

# Linux System Administration Guide

## 1. Logical Volume Management (LVM)

LVM is a storage management system that adds an abstraction layer above physical devices, allowing more flexible disk space management than traditional partitions.

### LVM Hierarchical Structure

LVM uses a three-level hierarchical structure:

1. **Physical Volumes (PV)**
   - Physical storage devices like hard drives or SSDs
   - Can be entire partitions or whole disks
   - Initialized with the `pvcreate` command

2. **Volume Groups (VG)**
   - Groups of physical volumes aggregated into a single storage space
   - Allow combining multiple disks into one storage pool
   - Created with the `vgcreate` command

3. **Logical Volumes (LV)**
   - "Virtual partitions" within a Volume Group
   - Can be resized dynamically without system restart
   - Created with the `lvcreate` command

### LVM Advantages
- ‚úì **Flexibility**: Resize logical volumes without worrying about partition structure
- ‚úì **Snapshot**: Create backups without interrupting system operation
- ‚úì **Dynamic Management**: Add new disks without redesigning the partition table

## 2. LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)

LUKS is the encryption standard for Linux disks, protecting data from unauthorized access. Unlike other encryption methods, LUKS offers centralized key management and is compatible with various security tools.

VirtualBox offers disk encryption through three simple steps:
1. **Activation**: Virtual disk settings ‚Üí Enable encryption ‚Üí Set password
2. **Usage**: When starting the VM ‚Üí Enter password ‚Üí Access disk
3. **Operation**: After unlocking ‚Üí Transparent usage ‚Üí Automatic encryption/decryption

This mechanism protects VM data even if someone physically accesses the virtual disk files.

## 3. Linux Directory Hierarchy

Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines the arrangement of major directories:

- üìÇ **/**: Root directory from which all other directories branch
  - Contains essential files for system boot and operation

- üìÇ **/home**: Contains users' personal directories
  - Each user has their own subdirectory (`/home/username`)

- üìÇ **/var**: Contains variable data like system logs, cache, and print spools
  - For example, `/var/log` stores system event logs

- üìÇ **/tmp**: Temporary area for files created by applications
  - Automatically cleared on each reboot

- üìÇ **/srv**: Contains data used by network services, like websites served by a web server

- üìÇ **swap**: Disk space used as virtual memory to support RAM when it's full


## 2. What are Partitions?

A partition is a logical subdivision of a physical disk. Imagine your hard drive as one big room: if you want to organize it better, you can divide it with walls into multiple rooms (partitions). Each partition can be used for different purposes (operating system, data, swap, etc.).

When you install an operating system, you can choose to:

- Use the entire disk without partitions (not recommended).
- Split the disk into multiple partitions to separate the operating system, data, and other things.

## 3. Types of Partitions: Primary, Extended, Logical

Disks can be divided into 3 types of partitions:

### Primary (Primary Partition)

- This is the main partition where the operating system is installed.
- A disk can have up to 4 primary partitions.
- If you want more than 4 partitions, you need to use an extended partition.

### Extended (Extended Partition)

- Acts as a "container" for other partitions.
- It can contain multiple logical partitions.
- A disk can have only one extended partition.

### Logical (Logical Partition)

- These are created inside an extended partition.
- Linux can manage up to 15 logical partitions on a disk.
- You can use them to separate the operating system from data.

### Practical Example

Let's say you have a 100GB disk. You can divide it as follows:

- **Primary Partition (30GB)** ‚Üí Contains Linux (/boot, /root, etc.)
- **Extended Partition (70GB)** ‚Üí Contains multiple logical partitions:
  - **Logical 1 (20GB)** ‚Üí /home (documents, user files)
  - **Logical 2 (10GB)** ‚Üí /swap (virtual memory)
  - **Logical 3 (40GB)** ‚Üí /var (logs, cache, etc.)

üí° **Why are partitions used in Born2BeRoot?**

- Separate `/boot` (500MB) to protect the system in case of issues.
- Create an encrypted logical partition for added security.
